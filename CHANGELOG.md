## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Project skeleton on the `llm-data-axi` pattern: Go module `github.com/samestrin/llm-extract-axi` and an `llm-extract` root command whose version is stamped at build time. An unknown command exits non-zero.
- `Makefile` with `build`, `build-all`, `test`, `test-race`, `test-cover`, `cover-gate`, `lint`, `vet`, `fmt`, `golangci`, `install`, `clean` and `hooks` targets. `build` covers every binary under `cmd/`, and the test targets build first.
- CI: `lint` (`go vet`, `gofmt -s`, `golangci-lint` v2.12.2) → `make build` → `go test -race` with coverage → an 80% coverage gate that fails the build, plus a five-platform cross-compile matrix with a 20MB binary size gate.
- `tests/e2e` runs the built binary, and fails rather than skips when it has not been built.
- `AGENTS.md`, `README.md` and `.golangci.yml`.
